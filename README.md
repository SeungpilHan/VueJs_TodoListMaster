# Vuejs ToDo App
A to-do list is a simple but effective way to manage tasks.

Live Demo: https://d2phap.github.io/vuejs-todo

## User Stories
- As a user, I need to be able to add an activity (item to the list).
- As a user, I need to be able to update the activity (toggle status between
completed/not completed).
- As a user, I need to be able to delete the activity.
- As a user, I need to be able to list all the activities when the page is first loaded or
reloaded.

## Notes
- A sample Vue.js project can be created via vue-cli as explained here:
https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli
- The application should follow the Flux/Redux architecture principles in terms of app
state management and uni-directional data flow.
- In order to maintain the list state between the page reloads, you can use
localStorage.
- Design and create an API blueprint for the REST API using the service of your choice,
this API should cover all the user stories above.
